// Events are our way of letting you know when something interesting happens in

// event, and when an invoice payment attempt fails, we create an
// `invoice.payment_failed` event. Certain API requests might create multiple
// events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a
// customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a
// `charge.succeeded` event.
//
// Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event's data
// field embeds the resource's state at the time of the change. For
// example, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an
// `invoice.payment_failed` event contains an invoice.
//
// As with other API resources, you can use endpoints to retrieve an

// webhooks in your
// [account settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/webhooks). Learn how
// to [listen for events]
// (/docs/webhooks) so that your integration can automatically trigger reactions.
//
