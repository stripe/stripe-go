Go Stripe [![GoDoc](http://img.shields.io/badge/godoc-reference-blue.svg)](http://godoc.org/github.com/stripe/stripe-go) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/stripe/stripe-go.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/stripe/stripe-go)
========

##NOTE:
This is a cloned repo that allows for adding metadata to a charge.  Stripe's official library does not allow for this.  This library allows adding metadata fields and values like the libraries for other languages allow.  This is the only change, yet an important one, in this forked repo.  You can use this repo in place of the official Stripe library.

Please see the github.com/stripe/stripe-go page for full details on this library.
