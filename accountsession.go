// An AccountSession allows a Connect platform to grant access to a connected account in Connect embedded components.
//
// We recommend that you create an AccountSession each time you need to display an embedded component
// to your user. Do not save AccountSessions to your database as they expire relatively
// quickly, and cannot be used more than once.
//
// Related guide: [Connect embedded components](https://stripe.com/docs/connect/get-started-connect-embedded-components)

	//
	// The client secret can be used to provide access to `account` from your frontend. It should not be stored, logged, or exposed to anyone other than the connected account. Make sure that you have TLS enabled on any page that includes the client secret.
