// At any time, you can preview the upcoming invoice for a subscription or subscription schedule. This will show you all the charges that are pending, including subscription renewal charges, invoice item charges, etc. It will also show you any discounts that are applicable to the invoice.

// You can also preview the effects of creating or updating a subscription or subscription schedule, including a preview of any prorations that will take place. To ensure that the actual proration is calculated exactly the same as the previewed proration, you should pass the subscription_details.proration_date parameter when doing the actual subscription update.
//
// The recommended way to get only the prorations being previewed on the invoice is to consider line items where parent.subscription_item_details.proration is true.
