// Secret Store is an API that allows Stripe Apps developers to securely persist secrets for use by UI Extensions and app backends.
//
// The primary resource in Secret Store is a `secret`. Other apps can't view secrets created by an app. Additionally, secrets are scoped to provide further permission control.
//
// All Dashboard users and the app backend share `account` scoped secrets. Use the `account` scope for secrets that don't change per-user, like a third-party API key.
//
// A `user` scoped secret is accessible by the app backend and one specific Dashboard user. Use the `user` scope for per-user secrets like per-user OAuth tokens, where different users might have different permissions.
